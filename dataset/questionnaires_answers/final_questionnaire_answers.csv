11,2,12.792200000286105,lost focus in final round,1,survey does seem very long and makes it diffiult to keep focus- sometimes i felt like I was purposely selecting time duration as shorter to make study go quicker. also don't like that the breaks were a minimum of 3 minutes- this is quite long and longer than i wanted on most of them- could easily cut this down to mandatory 1 minute and can take longer if you want,58,123,3,4,4725.811900000095,353
